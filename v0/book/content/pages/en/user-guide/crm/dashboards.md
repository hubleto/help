# Dashboards
The Dashboards section lets you visualize data and key metrics in Hubleto. 

Each dashboard is made up of panels, which display different indicators – for example, lead value, open deals without a plan, highest-value deals, or your scheduled tasks.

With dashboards, all critical information is in one place, so you don’t have to search across different modules.
