# Customers

Customers in the application represent **companies or businesses** that you manage. Each customer record contains essential details such as company name, address, tax information, and other relevant data. Additionally, you can assign contacts to each customer.

> üí° Before creating a contact, you must first have a customer created. Contacts are linked to customers, and adding them through the Customers module ensures proper association.
