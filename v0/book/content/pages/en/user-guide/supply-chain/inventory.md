# Inventory

 The Inventory section is used to record stock in warehouses. 
 
 Here you can track which product is stored in which warehouse, its quantity, status, and additional data such as batch numbers, serial numbers, or received/expiration dates. Inventory is tightly linked to the Warehouses module, so each item must be assigned to a specific warehouse location.
