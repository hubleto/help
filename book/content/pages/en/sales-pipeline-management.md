## Leads and Deals in Ceremony CRM

In Ceremony CRM, **leads** and **deals** let you manage potential customers and focus on the right opportunities at each stage of the sales pipeline.

### What is a Lead?

A **lead** represents a potential sales opportunity—someone interested in your product or service but not yet qualified as a customer. Leads are at the early stages of the sales pipeline and may require follow-up to assess their fit.

#### Benefits of Using Leads:

- **Focus on Key Opportunities:** Identify promising leads and use resources effectively.
- **Build Relationships:** Engage leads and introduce them to your offerings.
- **Qualify Prospects:** Move only qualified leads forward, saving time and effort.

### What is a Deal?

A **deal** is a qualified opportunity with a high likelihood of closing, often involving customers who need your product or service and may already be in negotiation stages.

#### Benefits of Using Deals:

- **Prioritize Sales Efforts:** Focus on opportunities likely to close and optimize resources.
- **Forecast Revenue:** Deals help in planning by estimating potential revenue.
- **Close More Sales:** Track deal stages to spot and resolve any issues in the process.

By organizing leads and deals, Ceremony CRM enables you to:

- **Improve Conversion Rates:** Strategically nurture leads and manage deals to boost success.
- **Gain Pipeline Visibility:** Track each opportunity’s stage to make better decisions.
