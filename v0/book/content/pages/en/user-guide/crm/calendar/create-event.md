# Create an event

In the left menu, go to `CRM` → `Calendar`.

The weekly calendar will open (you can switch between: day / week / month / list).


**On the left side, you can enable or disable individual calendars:**

`Default`

`Customers`

`Deals`

`Leads`

`Orders`

`Projects`


## How to add a new activity:

Click the + New activity button or directly into an empty slot in the calendar.

Select the calendar the activity belongs to (e.g., Customers, Projects).

An event form will open where you fill in:

Subject – activity title (e.g., “Meeting”).

Activity type – type of activity (meeting, call, task).

Start / End – start and end date/time.

Meeting minutes (link) – link to notes or documents.

Completed – toggle when the activity is finished.

Click Add to save the event.


## How to manage existing activities:
Click on an activity in the calendar to open its details.

Here you can edit the information or delete the activity.


## Tips
Use color-coded calendars – you’ll instantly know whether it’s a customer, project, or deal.

Use list view for a quick overview of all events.

By linking with Customers or Deals, you always have full context in one place.


## Common mistakes
Event not showing: Check if the correct calendar is enabled in the left panel.

Incorrect time zone: At first setup, verify your timezone, otherwise events may shift.

Unmarked “Completed”: If you finish an activity but don’t mark it, it will still appear unfinished.


## Summary
The Calendar helps you plan meetings, tasks, and customer-related activities.

Add a new activity via + New activity or by clicking into the calendar.

Every activity can be edited or deleted anytime.

Calendar colors make navigation quick and easy.
