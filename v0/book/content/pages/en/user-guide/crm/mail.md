# Mail

The Mail section in Hubleto is used for sending, receiving, and managing emails directly within the CRM. 

This way, all customer communication is stored in one place, and you don’t need to switch between multiple applications.


**Section breakdown:**
* **Internal emails** – internal management of emails (templates, scheduling, sending).

* **External accounts** – managing and linking external email accounts (e.g., Gmail, Outlook).
