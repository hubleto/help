# Sales Pipeline Management

The Sales module in Ceremony helps track and manage sales opportunities, from initial contact to deal closure, making the sales process organized and transparent.

## Understanding Leads and Deals in Ceremony CRM

In Ceremony CRM, **leads** and **deals** help businesses manage sales opportunities, organize potential customers, and increase sales effectiveness by focusing on the right opportunities at each stage of the pipeline.

### What is a Lead?

A **lead** is a potential sales opportunity, often representing someone who has shown interest in your product or service but has not yet been qualified as a customer. Leads are generally in the early stages of the sales pipeline, requiring additional outreach to determine if they are a good fit for your offerings.

#### Why Use Leads?

Tracking leads helps your team identify potential customers early in the sales cycle and ensures that no opportunity goes unnoticed. Managing leads effectively allows you to:

- **Focus on Key Leads:** Identify high-potential leads and use resources wisely.  
- **Build Relationships:** Connect with leads and educate them about your offerings.  
- **Qualify Prospects:** Only qualified leads move forward, saving your teamâ€™s time.

### What is a Deal?

A **deal** is a qualified sales opportunity with a high chance of closing. It typically involves customers or companies with a real need for your product or service, and negotiations are either ongoing or expected soon.

#### Why Use Deals?

Tracking deals is crucial for managing revenue opportunities and forecasting sales. Deals help your team to:

- **Optimize the Sales Pipeline:** Focus on opportunities with a higher probability of closing, ensuring efficient use of resources.
- **Forecast Revenue:** Deals provide estimates of potential revenue, aiding in financial planning and goal setting.
- **Close More Sales:** With clear tracking of each deal stage, teams can identify and address bottlenecks in the sales process.
