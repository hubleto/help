# Projects

The Projects section is used to manage projects, tasks, and work logs.

Here you’ll find:

  * **Tasks** → for managing individual assignments.
  * **Worksheets** → for recording worked hours.
  * **Projects** → for overall project management, budgets, and phases.
  * **Issues** → for tracking problems and errors during the project.

As in other parts of Hubleto, you can also use the **funnel icon** (filter) and **gear icon** (column settings) to customize your view.
