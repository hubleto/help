Modular opensource ERP and CRM that helps your business grow.

## What is Hubleto?

Hubleto is a platform to develop, deploy and use business applications of any kind. In most cases, it can be used as an opensource CRM or ERP solution.

  * **CRM** (Customer Relationship Management) is all about keeping track of your customers, conversations, and sales processes. It helps you build better relationships with your customers and close more deals.
  * **ERP** (Enterprise Resource Planning) does the same for your entire business. It connects everything from inventory and finance to employee management and project tracking. 

Together, a CRM and ERP give you a complete overview of your business, allowing you to make smarter decisions and save time on the things that matter most.
