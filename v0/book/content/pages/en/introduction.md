# Introduction

Welcome to Hubleto!

Hubleto is a modern tool that helps you keep all your important information under control – from contacts and documents to dashboards and charts.

No more complicated spreadsheets or endless searching in emails. Everything you need for your work is right here in one place.

This guide is your companion to Hubleto. Inside you’ll find:

  * **Basic steps** → how to log in, create your first contact, or dashboard.
  * **Detailed tutorials** → step-by-step instructions with screenshots.
  * **Tips and tricks** → how to work faster and more efficiently.
  * **FAQ and troubleshooting** → what to do when something doesn’t work as expected.

Our goal is to make Hubleto simple and stress-free for you. Each tutorial is designed to save you time and clicks – and help you get oriented quickly even without technical knowledge.

If this is your first time using Hubleto, we recommend starting with the [Getting Started](getting-started) chapter, where you’ll learn the basics of working with the app.
