# Sales

The Sales section in Hubleto allows you to manage the sales process from suppliers all the way to customer orders.

Here you’ll find:

  * **Suppliers** → manage suppliers and their data.
  * **Deals** → record and manage business opportunities.
  * **Products** → product and service database.
  * **Orders** → manage customer orders.

All modules work on the same principle – table view, filtering (via the funnel icon), sorting by columns (up/down arrows), adding new items, and managing detailed data.  

A gear icon is also available for CSV export/import and column visibility settings.
