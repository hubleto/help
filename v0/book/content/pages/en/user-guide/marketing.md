# Marketing

The Marketing section in Hubleto allows you to manage and track all marketing activities.

Here you’ll find:

  * **Campaigns** → for managing marketing campaigns (email, online, event-based…).
  * **Leads** → for recording and working with potential customers.

Just like in CRM, you have access to a simple table view, the ability to filter, add new items, and click through to details.

## Table of contents

{% include 'components/table-of-contents-from-pages-folder.twig' with {
  'folder': 'en/user-guide/marketing',
  'maxLevel': 2,
} %}
