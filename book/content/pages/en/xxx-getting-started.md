## What are CRM and ERP?

Managing your business can feel overwhelming at times. That’s where **CRM** and **ERP** systems come in to help.

* **CRM** (Customer Relationship Management) is all about keeping track of your customers, conversations, and sales processes. It helps you build better relationships with your customers and close more deals.

* **ERP** (Enterprise Resource Planning) does the same for your entire business. It connects everything from inventory and finance to employee management and project tracking.

Together, a CRM and ERP give you a complete overview of your business, allowing you to make smarter decisions and save time on the things that matter most.
