# How to Add Activities  

The **Customers, Leads, and Deals** apps allow users to add activities related to specific records. The activity form includes several required and optional fields to ensure all relevant details are captured. The activities you add are tied directly to customers, leads, or deals and help you track engagements, meetings, and tasks.
