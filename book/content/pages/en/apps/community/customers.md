## Managing Contacts within Customers

Each customer can have assigned contacts, which can be created directly from the **Customers** module. This ensures all contacts are properly linked to the correct business entity.

For managing contacts separately from the Customers module, refer to **[Contacts Guide](contacts)**.

> üí° **Key Distinction:** Customers and Contacts serve different purposes.  
> ‚úîÔ∏è **Customer** üè¢ ‚Üí A company or business entity.  
> ‚úîÔ∏è **Contact** üë§ ‚Üí An individual associated with that company, such as a representative or employee.
