# Maintenance

The Maintenance section is used to manage notifications, settings, and system tools.

It is the technical background of the application where you can adjust Hubleto’s behavior to your needs, track alerts, and use tools that make your work easier.

Here you’ll find:

  * **Notifications** → center for all system alerts
  * **Settings** → account, system, and global configurations
  * **Tools** → a set of utilities for administration and maintenance
