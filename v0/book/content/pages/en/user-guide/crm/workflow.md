# Workflow

The Workflow section is used to define and visualize processes in Hubleto. 

With workflows, you can set up specific stages that a customer, project, task, or campaign must go through.

**Examples:**
Deal → Prospecting → Qualified → Quote Sent → Under Review → Contracting → Won/Lost.


Project → Preparation → Implementation → Testing → Delivered.


Thanks to workflows, you always have a clear overview of the status of all activities and can better manage both the team and results.
